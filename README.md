IoT Homework 4

csv - have converted present and absent to 1 and 0 in initial data set
otherwise decent results for 1000 random samples

#TO DO

output format - result.csv has split string

svm parameter - put in temp paramters. confirm finals
param = svm_parameter('-s 0 -t 2 -c 2')

empty values - light has lots of 0. deal with zero values

executable - create executable file
